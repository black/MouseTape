### Measure length using your computer mouse

This demo showcases an innovative Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) application that transforms a standard computer mouse into a tool for measuring length. To use the app, simply connect the mouse, flip it upside down, and roll the mouse wheel along a surface to measure distances. The app tracks the movement of the wheel, providing a unique and interactive way to measure length using a familiar device. This project demonstrates the potential for everyday peripherals to be repurposed for new, intuitive forms of interaction.
