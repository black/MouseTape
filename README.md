### Measure length using your computer mouse

This demo focus on a innovative Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concept that allows users to measure length using a computer mouse. To use the app, simply start it, connect your mouse, and then flip the mouse upside down. By rolling the mouse wheel along a surface, users can measure distances interactively.
